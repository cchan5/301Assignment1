A TODO list Android app for CMPUT 301.

How To Use:
-------------
This is a TODO list application allows users to enter a todo item by entering text into the text field and adding it to the list via the add button. The user can then check off completed tasks, or uncheck them. By long clicking an item, the user can select single or multiple items to delete, archive, or email. Archiving items will transfer the selected items to the archive tab and will be displayed there. The user can also unarchive tasks and email archived tasks. 

In the overflow menu, the user can choose to see the summary information of the todo and archived items, set the email address to where they want to email items to, or they can email all items including archived to the set email.

The user can navigate between tabs by either clicking on the corresponding tabs, or they can swipe to either tab.
